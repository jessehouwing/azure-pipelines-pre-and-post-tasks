# Pre and Post job scrept tasks

This extension creates 2 extra versions of the CmdLine, Bash and PowerShell tasks. One that will execute pre-job and one that will execute port-job.

I use these tasks to test things I could otherwise only do in decorators without havign to enable these tasks for all workflows all at once.

This will allow you to run inline code prior to checkout.
